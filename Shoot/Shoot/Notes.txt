TODO:
* Seperate asset TXT files for each player.
* Player will not handle its own texture. Instead it will have an animation class that will handle it.
* Animation class can ask the contentloader for a list of the assetnames pertaining to the player the animation class belongs to.
* Animation class can then use that list to get all the relevant textures and store them in by animation category
* CONTENTLOADER: Maybe have different contentmanagers for map and for players. Not essential but good practice


Completed:
INputmanager auto adds new controllers even mid game. this way we can have players join mid game
Offset where projectiles are fired from the player
Make sure the player cant shoot himself
