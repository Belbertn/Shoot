TODO:
* Player will not handle its own texture. Instead it will have an animation class that will handle it.
* Animation class can ask the contentloader for a list of the assetnames pertaining to the player the animation class belongs to.
* Animation class can then use that list to get all the relevant textures and store them in by animation category
* CONTENTLOADER: Maybe have different contentmanagers for map and for players. Not essential but good practice
* The Asset TXT files will be listed by animation. So the animation class can find both the texture and what animation it belongs to


Completed:
* Seperate asset TXT files for each player.
* INputmanager auto adds new controllers even mid game. this way we can have players join mid game
* Offset where projectiles are fired from the player
* Make sure the player cant shoot himself
